# Stock-Market-Prediction

# *Introduction*

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.Stock market prediction analysis is the process of using historical stock data to make predictions about future stock prices. This can be a complex task, but it can be done with a basic understanding of Python and machine learning.

Predicting stock market movements is a challenging task, and there's no foolproof method to predict the future with absolute certainty. However, you can use Python and various data analysis and machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can provide insights into potential market trends. 

Prediction methodologies fall into three broad categories which can (and often do) overlap. They are :

-Fundamental analysis

-Technical analysis (charting) and 

-Technological methods.

# *Prerequisites*

To perform stock market prediction analysis using Python, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Tensorflow
* keras 

# *Data Loading and Text Cleaning*

The first step in stock market prediction analysis is to load and clean the data. This involves loading the historical stock data from a source such as a financial website or API, and then cleaning the data to remove any errors or inconsistencies.

# *Data Visualization*

Once the data is clean, you can use data visualization tools to explore and understand the data. This can help you to identify trends and patterns in the data that can be used to make predictions.

# *Model Training and Building*

Next, you need to train a machine learning model to predict stock prices. This involves feeding the model the historical stock data and letting it learn the relationships between the features and the target variable (i.e., stock price).

# *Validation*

Once the model is trained, you need to evaluate its performance on a held-out test set. This can be done using a technique called 5-fold cross-validation. In 5-fold cross-validation, you split the data into 5 folds and train and evaluate the model on each fold. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data.

# *Model Testing*

Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, you can test it on new data. This involves feeding the model new data and getting the predicted stock prices.

# *Conclusion*

Stock market prediction analysis using Python is a complex task, but it can be done with a basic understanding of Python and machine learning. By following the steps outlined above, you can develop Python models that can make more accurate predictions about stock prices.
Stock market prediction analysis using Python is a powerful tool that can be used to make more informed predictions about future stock prices. By following the steps outlined above, you can develop Python models that can help you to make better investment decisions. However, it is important to note that stock market prediction is a difficult task, and no model can predict the future with perfect accuracy.
